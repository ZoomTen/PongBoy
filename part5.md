# Conclusion

## End result

So with all of that done, here's the "game" I managed to come up with. All the basic stuff since the last review is here, but it's been enhanced with a title screen and a fade transition between states.

## Known Bugs

* Quirks with the ball getting stuck on the edge

* Paddle hitbox detection is not perfect (it sometimes overshoots)

* The ball moves at speed 1 both horizontally and vertically. This technically means that at serve, the ball moves at speed 1, but it bounces around at speed 1&radic;2.

* The right paddle jitters a bunch if the ball's vertical position doesn't change.

## Suggestions

Left as an exercise to the viewer. :p

* More screens / game modes.

* Game Boy Color support.

* Better enemy AI.

* Configurable difficulty settings.

* Maybe moving in the X direction as well?
